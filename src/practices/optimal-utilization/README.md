Given 2 lists a and b. Each element is a pair of integers where the first integer represents the unique id and the second integer represents a value. Your task is to find an element from a and an element form b such that the sum of their values is less or equal to target and as close to target as possible. Return a list of ids of selected elements. If no pair is possible, return an empty list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
a = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6]]
b = [[1, 2]]
target = 7

Output: [[2, 1]]

Explanation:
There are only three combinations [1, 1], [2, 1], and [3, 1], which have a total sum of 4, 6 and 8, respectively.
Since 6 is the largest sum that does not exceed 7, [2, 1] is the optimal pair.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
a = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7], [4, 10]]
b = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
target = 10

Output: [[2, 4], [3, 2]]

Explanation:
There are two pairs possible. Element with id = 2 from the list `a` has a value 5, and element with id = 4 from the list `b` also has a value 5.
Combined, they add up to 10. Similarily, element with id = 3 from `a` has a value 7, and element with id = 2 from `b` has a value 3.
These also add up to 10. Therefore, the optimal pairs are [2, 4] and [3, 2].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
a = [[1, 8], [2, 7], [3, 14]]
b = [[1, 5], [2, 10], [3, 14]]
target = 20

Output: [[3, 1]]
Example 4:

Input:
a = [[1, 8], [2, 15], [3, 9]]
b = [[1, 8], [2, 11], [3, 12]]
target = 20

Output: [[1, 3], [3, 2]]
```
